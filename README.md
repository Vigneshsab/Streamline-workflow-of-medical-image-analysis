# Streamline-workflow-of-medical-image-analysis

This project is used to find diseases based on the skin images. Instead of doctors seeing the images and predicting what disease he might have, this system automatically analyses the images and predicts what disease he has. This is an AI based system which classifies skin cancer in real time with the help of android smartphones.
